I heard about this course from Kimmo's Facebook posting. I work as a mathematician at Kela where I have recently started learning to use Rstudio and GitHub. This seemed like a perfect course to deepen my knowledge of these tools. 
I also boldly hope that this course will give me new career opportunities! 
**Thus, feeling very excited about this course!**
